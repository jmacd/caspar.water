This is a semi-annual statement of the cost of operations for the
Caspar Water Company.  Listed below are total expenses for serving
water across four categories from {{.StartDate}} through {{.EndDate}}.

Operations costing {{.Operations}} include expenses associated with
water treatment, inspection, monitoring, and chemicals.  Utilities
costing {{.Utilities}} include electricity, primarily for pumping.
Taxes costing {{ .Taxes }} are half of the yearly property taxes
assessed to the system.  Insurance fees costing {{ .Insurance }} are
half of the yearly general liability insurance required to operate the
company.

Note that billing is per connection and not based on individual usage.
Your bill represents {{.Percent}} of our semi-annual expenses.  This
fraction is calculated by dividing your connection's weight
({{.UserWeight }}) by the effective number of connections
({{.EffectiveUserCount }}) in the system.

We are in an introductory phase during which the effective number of
connections is inflated by new connections that we plan to add over
the next three years.  The inflated number of connections serves to
lower each current connection's share of costs as we grow the system.

We are also in an introductory phase during which expenses are passed
through with no additional operating margin to build our financial
reserve.  The operating margin is set to rise to 10% of total expenses
in October 2023 and 20% of total expenses in October 2024 statement.
